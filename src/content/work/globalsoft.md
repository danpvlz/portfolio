Globalsoft is a Single Page Application (SPA) that I developed to streamline and optimize the internal processes of the institution. This comprehensive solution enhances efficiency and collaboration among the institution's teams, facilitating various tasks and operations. The project was divided into Front-End and Back-End development using a range of cutting-edge technologies, including React, Redux, PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Firebase, and Power BI. Key functionalities were implemented, such as email notifications, real-time alerts, and JWT authentication, all of which significantly improved workflow and communication.

## Key Features:

- **Front-End Development (React and Redux)**:
Utilizing React and Redux, the Front-End of Globalsoft was designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for institution personnel. This modern approach ensures dynamic and responsive web interactions.

- **Back-End Development (PHP, Laravel, MySQL)**:
The Back-End of the application was developed using PHP, Laravel, and MySQL, ensuring robust data management, scalability, and security.

- **Email Notifications with Laravel and SMTP**:
Implemented email notifications using Laravel and SMTP, allowing the institution to effectively communicate with its clients and members.

- **Real-Time Notifications with Firebase**:
Real-time notifications were integrated using Firebase, enabling instantaneous alerts and updates. For example, managers are notified when a new client registers or an active client cancels a membership.

- **JWT Authentication**:
The application employs JWT authentication, enhancing security and ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information and perform specific actions.

- **Power BI Dashboards for Managers**:
I created customized dashboards using Power BI for managers, offering a data-driven view of critical information and insights.

- **Modules for Various Areas and Managers**:
Multiple modules were designed to cater to different areas and managers within the institution, enabling efficient management of clients, payments, available services, reservations, and more.

- **Virtual Cards for Partner Status**:
Virtual cards were introduced to visualize partner status, making it easy to identify whether a partner is in the process of registration, enabled, or disabled.

Globalsoft is a testament to my full-stack development capabilities, demonstrating the successful integration of numerous technologies to create a robust and versatile internal processes management system. This project showcases my commitment to delivering innovative solutions that optimize workflow and facilitate effective communication within institutions.
