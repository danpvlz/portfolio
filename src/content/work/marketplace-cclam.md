Previously, there was no online marketplace for local merchants in the region to reach customers effectively. Recognizing this gap in the market, we embarked on the development of a platform that unites regional merchants, enabling them to reach a nationwide audience with 24/7 online sales. Our solution offers the flexibility for users to negotiate directly with merchants for bulk purchases.

This system, built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, and hosted on Vercel, encompasses modules tailored for both merchants and users. Users have the option to make purchases through the platform or initiate direct contact with merchants. With LocalMarket, we've bridged the gap between local merchants and nationwide consumers, offering a seamless online shopping experience that fosters growth for businesses in the region.

## Technologies Used:

- Design: Adobe XD
- Frontend: React, Redux
- Backend: Node.js, Next.JS
