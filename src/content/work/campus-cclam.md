CampusCCLAM is an innovative e-learning platform designed to revolutionize the way CCLAM clients acquire knowledge. In an effort to expand and enhance the company's services, CCLAM sought the creation of an online learning platform, which now enables clients to access courses 24/7. Previously, the company offered courses with certifications through Zoom. This new platform has been designed to reach a broader audience, allowing users to complete courses on flexible schedules. The website features modules that facilitate student registration, the option to add courses to a shopping cart, make purchases through the platform, track progress in each course, and view achievement reports.

As part of the project, I implemented user authentication, providing seamless access to the platform through Google accounts. Additionally, I integrated email notification functionalities to keep users informed about important updates and milestones in their learning journey. Furthermore, I designed an intuitive course management interface to enhance the overall user experience.

Built with React, Next.js, and PostgreSQL, this project highlights my expertise in full-stack development, with a strong emphasis on user-centric design.
