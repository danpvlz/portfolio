KAP Business Diagnosis is a Single Page Application (SPA) that I developed to offer a range of analytical tools and reports aimed at providing comprehensive insights into various aspects of a business. This dynamic platform enables users to perform managerial, commercial, product, market, business landscape, and financial analysis. The project was a collaborative effort, involving professionals from various domains, including managers, accountants, and marketing experts, right from its inception. The application was meticulously designed, employing web services and design patterns to ensure robust functionality. The frontend was built using React and Redux, while the backend was powered by Node.js, with MySQL serving as the database. To make it accessible to users, the SPA was deployed and maintained on cPanel.

## Key Features:
